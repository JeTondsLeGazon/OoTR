# Ocarina of Time Randomizer - Reinforcement learning

Test project on the Zelda game: [Ocarina of Time Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com). The goal is to finish the traditional OoT Zelda game the fastest.

I wanted to use deep reinforcement learning to optimize path to use depending on the current objects the user posseses ( = the state).
